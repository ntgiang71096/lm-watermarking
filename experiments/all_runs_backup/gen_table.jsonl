If he crushes the drills, he could vault up the draft board \u2014 perhaps into the first round. And he feels well-prepared because he\u2019s spent the past few months working out with some legendary NFL receivers in Calvin Johnson and Anquan Boldin.\nButler met Boldin at the South Florida gym where he trains. He was connected to Johnson through his agent.\nJohnson and Boldin are known for being precise, tactical receivers. But Butler says the most valuable lesson of working with them has been learning about how they think.\nButler admitted the first time he worked with Johnson, who went to six Pro Bowls with the Detroit Lions from 2010-15, that he was a little starstruck.\nButler is hoping that one day he can leave a legacy like Boldin or Johnson. But for now, his goal is to prove what he already believes is true: that he is the top receiver in this draft.", "orig_sample_length": 509, "prompt_length": 309, "real_completion_length": 200, "no_bl_gen_time": 4.5955610275268555, "w_bl_gen_time": 3.245359420776367, "spike_entropies": [[0.5678890347480774, 0.5677183270454407, 0.9581224322319031, 0.8965651392936707, 0.5861701369285583, 0.5683478713035583, 0.5696889162063599, 0.8360460996627808, 0.9273754954338074, 0.8869930505752563, 0.5677880048751831, 0.7300395369529724, 0.9812706708908081, 0.9875838160514832, 0.9621171355247498, 0.5749073624610901, 0.6811411380767822, 0.9535460472106934, 0.7353799939155579, 0.9284413456916809, 0.9077675938606262, 0.9793092608451843, 0.95265793800354, 0.6145110130310059, 0.8180355429649353, 0.8766210079193115, 0.9273809194564819, 0.739587664604187, 0.9577478170394897, 0.9329129457473755, 0.9884976148605347, 0.8509838581085205, 0.9238656759262085, 0.8072066903114319, 0.9470950961112976, 0.8991940021514893, 0.9249921441078186, 0.9511483311653137, 0.913668155670166, 0.8897268772125244, 0.7966715097427368, 0.9285497665405273, 0.8991100788116455, 0.5677353739738464, 0.5690516829490662, 0.9637831449508667, 0.8653737306594849, 0.9173768758773804, 0.5677328109741211, 0.5752098560333252, 0.9645419716835022, 0.7132912278175354, 0.8807787895202637, 0.5692405700683594, 0.9445865154266357, 0.6275514960289001, 0.8562704920768738, 0.957783579826355, 0.9782772064208984, 0.9814425110816956, 0.951994776725769, 0.8657747507095337, 0.979238748550415, 0.6339071989059448, 0.582478404045105, 0.8040603399276733, 0.9354778528213501, 0.953315794467926, 0.93574059009552, 0.9264252185821533, 0.9788161516189575, 0.8300925493240356, 0.9639872312545776, 0.750405490398407, 0.7809697389602661, 0.9519249200820923, 0.5934580564498901, 0.9444893598556519, 0.9276746511459351, 0.9386143088340759, 0.9033966064453125, 0.7777250409126282, 0.6875990629196167, 0.5979694128036499, 0.5683494806289673, 0.7543085813522339, 0.7725707292556763, 0.7505358457565308, 0.9225402474403381, 0.8647751212120056, 0.9106553196907043, 0.567905843257904, 0.5678620934486389, 0.9738733172416687, 0.8826642632484436, 0.6515790224075317, 0.6233422160148621, 0.7796863317489624, 0.8576942682266235, 0.5677422285079956, 0.6254650354385376, 0.9557633399963379, 0.9701505899429321, 0.8183436393737793, 0.7111863493919373, 0.8337660431861877, 0.9658198356628418, 0.9315586090087891, 0.8686464428901672, 0.7546417117118835, 0.9512710571289062, 0.5919365286827087, 0.8343359231948853, 0.9325068593025208, 0.813774049282074, 0.8193070888519287, 0.5677544474601746, 0.56817626953125, 0.8134128451347351, 0.8804243803024292, 0.8483580946922302, 0.8658612370491028, 0.9875580072402954, 0.8951574563980103, 0.9912954568862915, 0.8601124882698059, 0.8990311622619629, 0.7766714096069336, 0.9796409010887146, 0.8530430197715759, 0.6402711868286133, 0.8693512678146362, 0.9067431688308716, 0.5707657337188721, 0.9288750290870667, 0.863682746887207, 0.6064552664756775, 0.5679057836532593, 0.5676954388618469, 0.9241794943809509, 0.7442895174026489, 0.8887395262718201, 0.5794296264648438, 0.5706126689910889, 0.6070833206176758, 0.955077588558197, 0.8919212818145752, 0.5680943727493286, 0.9556099772453308, 0.8782345056533813, 0.9674103856086731, 0.957865297794342, 0.9093430042266846, 0.8208187818527222, 0.9597315192222595, 0.8762919902801514, 0.7926204204559326, 0.8628931045532227, 0.946402370929718, 0.8245388865470886, 0.9089876413345337, 0.6971075534820557, 0.7626608610153198, 0.7810838222503662, 0.5683803558349609, 0.9120064973831177, 0.948350191116333, 0.7555172443389893, 0.8318568468093872, 0.9575037360191345, 0.9245800971984863, 0.7667239308357239, 0.86903977394104, 0.8077366352081299, 0.6156005263328552, 0.6988493204116821, 0.7584958672523499, 0.7304804921150208, 0.635621190071106, 0.5710663795471191, 0.6193752884864807, 0.5908108949661255, 0.6253745555877686, 0.8887937068939209, 0.5684321522712708, 0.8437312841415405, 0.8943535089492798, 0.9209786653518677, 0.7465147972106934, 0.8244948387145996, 0.9538930058479309, 0.9280389547348022, 0.7718849778175354, 0.638276994228363, 0.6127642393112183, 0.8406201601028442, 0.5680685639381409, 0.5952221751213074, 0.8492112755775452, 0.5847274661064148]], "no_bl_output": "\"Whoever gets him, they'll be getting a good one,\" David Montgomery said.\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Hakeem Butler has been surrounded by some of the best wide receivers on the planet this week at the NFL Scouting Combine.\nIt\u2019s an experience that might humble some.
